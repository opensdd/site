#### *Work In Progress*

Executable Recipe for the entire OpenSDD process is coming soon. Below is an overview of what it will provide.

## The Process

Need the big picture first? Start with the [Overview](../overview/).

## 1. Establish the Spec Repository

- Create a `specs/` root alongside your code.
- Track every project as a folder with its own living specs (e.g., `PROJECT-001/`).
- Version specs with Git so reviews, diffs, and automations work exactly like code.
- Keep it non-dogmatic—only adopt the folders that serve your team and evolve as you learn.

## 2. Define Living Project Structure

Within each project folder:

- `prd.md` – captures user intent, goals, acceptance criteria, and success metrics.
- `tech_brief.md` – maps requirements to architecture, APIs, and dependencies.
- `FEAT-###/feature.md` – one per user story, scoped to a releasable slice.
- `TASK-###/task.md` – PR-sized tasks that agents or developers can execute independently.

Consistent structure allows AI agents to follow links between specs and reuse the same context across iterations.

## 3. Capture Implementation-Time Specs

For every task, instruct your agent (or team) to maintain:

- `research.md` – discoveries about the current codebase or dependency graph.
- `plan.md` – concrete implementation steps, blockers, and decision points.
- `code.md` – running log of progress and changes performed.
- `review.md` – code review findings with links to resolved issues.
- `analysis.md` – comparison between the initial plan and final implementation, plus lessons learned.

These artifacts prevent “cold starts” when a future update needs to revisit the same area.

## 4. Integrate Your Automation Stack

OpenSDD is tooling agnostic. Plug in:

- Any AI coding agent (Codex, ClaudeCode, Cursor, Gemini, etc.).
- Your preferred IDE or terminal workflow.
- The [OSDD CLI](../osdd-cli/) to fetch and run opinionated automation recipes.
- Any repository host; Git-based workflows are all you need.

## 5. Iterate and Share

- Encourage teams to submit new recipes or specs via pull requests.
- Use the [Recipes Catalog](../recipes-catalog/) as a starting point for automation ideas.
- Feed learnings back into specs so every iteration ships with better context.

> 📘 **Tip:** Start with a single project and one recipe. Demonstrate faster iteration and higher confidence, then replicate the structure across additional teams.

## Contribute Back

- Open an issue or discussion in the relevant repository if you discover gaps or have ideas.
- Share anonymized specs or templates that others can adapt.
- Document how your organization applies OpenSDD and add a link to the [Further Reading](../resources/further-reading/) page.
