title: Marketplace Preview
description: Placeholder for the future OpenSDD recipe marketplace.
---

The OpenSDD Marketplace will become the home for curated automations, templates, and integrations contributed by the community. While it is under construction, here’s what to expect.

## Vision

- **Discoverability** – Browse recipes by category (documentation, QA, feature delivery, migrations, etc.).
- **Transparency** – Every listing links to source repositories plus required permissions.
- **Interoperability** – Recipes follow the same OpenSDD spec standards, so they slot directly into your existing projects.

## Current Options

- Explore the [official recipes repo](../../../recipes-catalog/) for vetted examples like `docs_update`.
- Use the [OSDD CLI](../../../osdd-cli/) to run recipes locally or in your preferred IDE.
- Prototype your own automations and share them back with the community.

## How to Contribute

1. Document the problem your recipe solves and the inputs it requires.
2. Follow the manifest best practices from the recipes catalog.
3. Include safety notes—shell commands, network access, and file operations.
4. Submit the recipe via pull request or community channels once the marketplace opens.

Want to help shape the marketplace itself? Comment on the relevant GitHub issues or propose a layout update in this documentation repo—everything lives in the open, so improvements are just a pull request away.
