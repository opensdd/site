description: What makes Open Spec-Driven Development unique and how to get oriented quickly.
---

OpenSDD is an open-source effort to make spec-driven development accessible to any team, organization, or individual. We gather repeatable structures, tools, and guides so humans and AI coding agents can collaborate with shared context.

## What Makes *Open* SDD Unique

1. **Non-dogmatic adoption** – The structure is intentionally lightweight. Layer OpenSDD on top of your existing processes and evolve it as you learn.
2. **Open standards first** – Markdown, Git, and other open formats power every artifact. Beyond your AI assistant of choice, no proprietary tooling is required.
3. **Tool-agnostic integrations** – Specs, recipes, and automations plug into any AI coding agent, IDE, or version control system. Bring your own stack.

## Spec-Driven Development at a Glance

- Specifications lead implementation work; code expresses what the specs describe.
- Context stays with the work—features and tasks reference the specs that informed them, so contributors never start cold.
- Iteration compounds because research notes, plan updates, and reviews remain alongside the relevant specs.
- Teams keep control of their tooling. OpenSDD overlays on top of conversations already happening in your repos and automation pipelines.

### Core Spec Artifacts

| Spec Type | Purpose | Typical Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Requirements Spec** | Defines user intent and success metrics. | Personas, acceptance criteria, KPIs, business goals. |
| **Tech Design Spec** | Maps requirements onto system architecture. | API contracts, data models, integration diagrams, constraints. |
| **Feature Specs** | Capture releasable slices of functionality. | Links back to requirements/tech specs, user flows, success criteria. |
| **Task Specs** | Describe PR-sized work units. | Implementation plan, risk notes, test strategy, references. |

Together these documents form a “living project” that evolves with every change. Features branch into tasks small enough for humans or agents to ship independently, yet the shared context keeps everyone aligned.

## Living Projects in Practice

1. **Structured hierarchy** – Projects → Features → Tasks mirrors how work is delivered.
2. **Cross references** – Specs link to one another so agents and maintainers can traverse dependencies quickly.
3. **Automation readiness** – Each task carries enough detail for an AI assistant to execute without guesswork.

## The Open Approach

OpenSDD pairs the living-project model with openness so the methodology stays portable across ecosystems.

### Open Standards over Proprietary Lock-In

- Specs live in plain text formats (Markdown/MDX) inside Git repositories.
- No required SaaS backends or custom databases—use the tools your team already trusts.

### Portable Project Structure

```
specs/
└── PROJECT-001-customer-portal/
    ├── prd.md
    ├── tech_brief.md
    ├── FEAT-002-authentication/
    │   ├── feature.md
    │   └── TASK-003-login-flow/task.md
    └── FEAT-004-dashboard/
        └── TASK-005-chart-refresh/task.md
```

This layout makes it easy for contributors and agents to inspect intent, history, and implementation details without additional tooling.

### Built for Autonomous Execution

- Tasks are PR-sized so an agent (or pair of agents) can complete them end-to-end.
- Specs capture research, plans, code updates, reviews, and after-action analysis. Future iterations start with richer context instead of rediscovering constraints.
- Automation policies can be codified as recipes (see the [Marketplace](../marketplace/overview/)) that enforce consistent flows.

### Collaboration Friendly

- Every change is traceable through Git history and pull requests.
- Teams can comment directly on specs or tasks during review cycles.
- Documentation stays close to implementation, making onboarding and knowledge transfer smoother.
- Contributions are always welcome—start a discussion, open an issue, or submit a pull request in the GitHub organization.
