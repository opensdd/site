title: OSDD CLI
description: The companion command-line tool that fetches context and runs OpenSDD recipes.
---

The [OSDD CLI](https://github.com/opensdd/osdd-cli) is a fully open source (MIT licensed) tool that streamlines how teams
discover, fetch, and execute OpenSDD recipes. It standardizes how AI-enabled flows can be declared and takes care
of repeatable preparation of the environment.

##### Example

Let's start with an example — this very website was prepared using an OpenSDD recipe!

We have created an `astro_site` recipe, which is instructed to generate a documentation website based on
[Astro Starlight](https://astro.build/themes/details/starlight/) and published to
[GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). All you need to do is install the OSDD CLI
```bash
brew install opensdd/tap/osdd
```

and run the following command:

```bash
osdd recipe execute astro_site -i codex
```

The CLI asks for user input, specifically in this case for the name of the web site, repo where the website should
be generated, any context information (other websites, local files, other git repos, etc) and for any other instructions
on how to generate the website. Then it launches the provided IDE (in this case - `codex`) and gets to work!

**How exactly does this work?**

In a nutshell, this command:
1. Downloaded this recipe - [astro_site](https://github.com/opensdd/recipes/tree/main/global/astro_site).
2. Asked for user input, which is also [pre-configured in the recipe](https://github.com/opensdd/recipes/blob/012cb69b08d261d1ae65661b0855b2c8fbb5075a/global/astro_site/recipe.yaml#L14-L27),
3. Created a new workspace directory in `~/osdd/workspace/astro_site` for [recipe's instruction](https://github.com/opensdd/recipes/blob/012cb69b08d261d1ae65661b0855b2c8fbb5075a/global/astro_site/recipe.yaml#L6C11-L6C36).
4. Downloaded all the context files and commands into the workspace.
5. Launched `codex` with the instruction to run `/astro_run` command, which maps to [this prompt](https://github.com/opensdd/recipes/blob/main/global/astro_site/resources/run.md).

After a while, the `codex` was done and the website was generated and after a couple tweaks, it was published and here
it is!


## Key Capabilities

- **Recipe execution** – Run curated automations from the [recipes catalog](../recipes-catalog/).
- **Context gathering** – Pulls manifests, prompt files, and repository snapshots into an IDE workspace.
- **Workspace automation** – Generates files, runs shell commands, and kicks off IDE flows end-to-end.
- **Cross-platform** – Prebuilt binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows, plus Homebrew support.
- **Open by default** – Configurations are plain YAML/JSON and live in Git.

## Installation

```bash
# macOS/Linux via Homebrew tap
brew install opensdd/tap/osdd

# or download a release binary
curl -L https://github.com/opensdd/osdd-cli/releases/latest -o osdd
chmod +x osdd
sudo mv osdd /usr/local/bin/
```

Prefer building from source? Clone the repo and run `make build` (requires Go 1.25.1+).

## Running a Recipe

```bash
osdd recipe execute docs_update --ide claude
```

Flags to know:

- `--ide` selects which IDE integration to launch (Codex, Claude, etc.).
- `--recipe-file` lets you point to a local manifest when authoring new automations.

## Using Your Own Recipes

The CLI also supports running recipes from an arbitrary publicly available repository. All you need to do is to
create a folder `opensdd_recipes` in the repository root and add a folder with then name of the recipe in it and a
`recipe.yaml` as a recipe declaration.

For example, a recipe from
```
https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO_NAME>/blob/main/opensdd_recipes/<RECIPE_NAME>/recipe.yaml
```
can be executed using
```bash
osdd recipe execute <OWNER>/<REPO_NAME>/<RECIPE_NAME> --ide claude
```

## Why It Matters

- **Helper role** – The CLI is a facilitator, not a gatekeeper. It ensures every automation starts with the right context and guardrails.
- **Repeatability** – Recipes encode best practices, like mandatory planning or review loops, so teams don’t reinvent the process every time.
- **Observability** – Logs and generated artifacts live alongside your specs, enriching the OpenSDD knowledge base.
- **Shareable** – You can now just share id of a recipe you created and let others try it out. No need to copy/paste
  prompts, download files manually, etc.
- **Interoperability** – Recipes work the same way (well, almost) across different IDEs/CLIs. E.g. the example above
  can be executed with either Claude or Codex, despite Codex formally not having support for slash-commands
  or even project-level prompts. OSDD takes care of instructing each coding agent the right way.

## Contribute

- Review open issues for starter tasks or propose new ideas via discussions.
- Improve the CLI by updating manifests, improving error messages, or adding recipe scaffolding helpers.
- Share feedback on packaging (Homebrew tap, releases) so everyone benefits from smoother installs.
