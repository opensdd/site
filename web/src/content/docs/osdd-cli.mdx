title: OSDD CLI
description: The companion command-line tool that fetches context and runs OpenSDD recipes.
---

The [OSDD CLI](https://github.com/opensdd/osdd-cli) is an MIT-licensed tool that streamlines how teams discover, fetch, and execute OpenSDD recipes. It handles workspace preparation so AI agents can focus on implementation.

## Key Capabilities

- **Recipe execution** – Run curated automations from the [recipes catalog](../recipes-catalog/).
- **Context gathering** – Pulls manifests, prompt files, and repository snapshots into an IDE workspace.
- **Workspace automation** – Generates files, runs shell commands, and kicks off IDE flows end-to-end.
- **Cross-platform** – Prebuilt binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows, plus Homebrew support.
- **Open by default** – Configurations are plain YAML/JSON and live in Git.

## Installation

```bash
# macOS/Linux via Homebrew tap
brew install opensdd/tap/osdd

# or download a release binary
curl -L https://github.com/opensdd/osdd-cli/releases/latest -o osdd
chmod +x osdd
sudo mv osdd /usr/local/bin/
```

Prefer building from source? Clone the repo and run `make build` (requires Go 1.25.1+).

## Running a Recipe

```bash
osdd recipe execute docs_update --ide claude
```

Flags to know:

- `--ide` selects which IDE integration to launch (Codex, Claude, etc.).
- `--recipe-file` lets you point to a local manifest when authoring new automations.

## Why It Matters

- **Helper role** – The CLI is a facilitator, not a gatekeeper. It ensures every automation starts with the right context and guardrails.
- **Repeatability** – Recipes encode best practices, like mandatory planning or review loops, so teams don’t reinvent the process every time.
- **Observability** – Logs and generated artifacts live alongside your specs, enriching the OpenSDD knowledge base.

## Contribute

- Review open issues for starter tasks or propose new ideas via discussions.
- Improve the CLI by updating manifests, improving error messages, or adding recipe scaffolding helpers.
- Share feedback on packaging (Homebrew tap, releases) so everyone benefits from smoother installs.
