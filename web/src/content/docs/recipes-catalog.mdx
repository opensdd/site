title: Recipes Catalog
description: Explore automation recipes that accelerate OpenSDD workflows.
---

OpenSDD recipes package context files, permissions, and execution metadata so the OSDD CLI can run complex flows without manual setup. The official catalog lives at [opensdd/recipes](https://github.com/opensdd/recipes) and is maintained entirely in the open.

## Repository Layout

From the repo’s [README](https://github.com/opensdd/recipes/blob/main/README.md):

- **Global recipes** are immediately runnable by ID (e.g., `astro_site`).
- **Manifests** use YAML or JSON and serialize the `ExecutableRecipe` protobuf.
- **Assets** sit beside each manifest—prompts, scripts, or templates referenced by the recipe.

## Trying a Recipe

```bash
osdd recipe execute astro_site --ide claude
```

The CLI will fetch the manifest, pull required context, and start the IDE automation named in the entry point (`docs_update_run` command in this example).

## Authoring Your Own

1. Fork or clone the repository.
2. Create a descriptive folder under `global/` (or another namespace if private).
3. Write `recipe.yaml` with:
   - `prefetch` commands to gather data.
   - `context` entries for files or Git references.
   - `ide` commands and permission policies.
4. Test locally via `osdd recipe execute dummy --recipe-file ./path/to/recipe.yaml --ide codex`.
5. Submit a pull request documenting intent, required permissions, expected outputs, and maintenance notes.

## Marketplace Roadmap

The [Marketplace placeholder](../marketplace/overview/) highlights how recipes will be discoverable from this site in the future—complete with categories, tags, maintainer attribution, and submission guidelines.
