			<h2>OpenSDD keeps specifications at the center of AI-assisted work.</h2>
        <p>
            It is a flavor of Spec Driven Development specifically designed around <strong>open standards</strong> and
            <strong>scalable</strong> from a solo developer to entire organizations.
        </p>
			<p>
				The project curates reusable structures, tooling, and recipes so anyone can practice
				spec-driven development in the open. Bring clarity to your team, contribute guides,
				and evolve the methodology together.

		<h2>What OpenSDD Focuses On</h2>
		<p class="lead">
			Everything we publish—templates, tooling, and guides—supports three simple principles.
		</p>
		<div class="card-grid">
			<article>
				<h4>Non-dogmatic & Inclusive</h4>
				<p>
					OpenSDD is intentionally lightweight so any team, organization, or individual can
					adopt the structure without changing how they work.
				</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h4>Built on Open Standards</h4>
				<p>
					The approach relies on open formats (Markdown, Git, YAML). Outside of an AI coding
					agent, no proprietary tooling is required.
				</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h4>Tool-Agnostic Integrations</h4>
				<p>
					Specs, recipes, and automations integrate with any IDE, version control system, or
					AI coding agent. Bring your own stack and plug right in.
				</p>
			</article>
		</div>
	</section>

	<section class="landing-section principles">
		<h2>Core Principles</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Specs before code:</strong> Outline intent and architecture before an AI agent commits changes.</li>
			<li><strong>PR-sized tasks:</strong> Work items remain reviewable and easy to hand off between contributors.</li>
			<li><strong>Captured learnings:</strong> Research logs, plans, and retros are versioned next to the specs.</li>
			<li><strong>Open and agnostic:</strong> The methodology stays portable across tools, teams, and AI platforms.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Get Started in Three Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Clone the repositories and adopt the shared spec folder structure in your projects.</li>
			<li>Document features as PR-sized tasks that capture research, plan, code, review, and analysis.</li>
			<li>Automate repetitive flows with the OSDD CLI and community recipes—or publish your own.</li>
